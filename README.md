# Flux üé¨

Flux is a cross-platform mobile video streaming application built with React Native and Expo for iOS and Android.

## Overview

Flux provides a seamless experience for browsing and watching movies and TV shows. It leverages the power of the **TMDB API** for rich metadata (summaries, posters, ratings, etc.) and integrates with the **Vidsrc API** to fetch streamable video links.

The application is entirely client-side, meaning no backend server is required for scraping or data processing. Flux handles everything directly on the device, offering a user-friendly interface with features designed for media consumption.

> [!WARNING]
> This application is developed for personal use and educational purposes. Due to its nature of accessing potentially copyrighted content via third-party APIs, it will **not** be published on the official App Store or Google Play Store as it may violate their terms of service.

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Cross-Platform:** Runs on both iOS and Android using a single codebase thanks to React Native and Expo.
*   **Rich Metadata:** Fetches detailed information about movies and TV shows from TMDB.
*   **Streaming Integration:** Retrieves video streaming links using the Vidsrc API.
*   **Watch Progress:** Saves your last watched position for movies and episodes.
*   **Auto-Play Next:** Automatically queues and plays the next episode in a series.
*   **Client-Side:** No need for a dedicated server; all processing happens within the app.
*   **Clean UI:** Designed with a focus on usability and a pleasant viewing experience.
