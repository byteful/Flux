# Flux

### **Overview**
Flux is a cross-platform mobile video streaming app for iOS and Android. It fetches metadata using the **TMDB API** and retrieves streamable video links via the **Vidsrc API**. The app is client-side only, so you don't have to host a server that does webscraping or anything. Flux handles all of that and has a pretty solid UI. It saves your last watching position, and it automatically goes to the next episode.

This app will not be published to the App Store, because I made it for my own use, and it also doesn't abide by Apple's rules because this app technically is "piracy." You can compile this app yourself and upload it to your phone, but I will not be providing public builds to avoid issues.

### **TO-DO**
- [ ] View seasons/episodes from video view
- [ ] Edit brightness from video view

### Suggestions and Bug Reports
Please don't hesitate to open an issue if you have a suggestion or a bug report. I plan on maintaining this project for my own use, and I'm happy to improve it if there are others using it.
